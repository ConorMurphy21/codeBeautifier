Two roads diverged_in a_yellow wood
And_sorry I_could_not_travel both
And_be one_traveler long_I stood
And_looked down one as_far as_I could
To where it_bent in_the undergrowth
Then took the_other as just as_fair
And_having perhaps the_better claim
Because it was grassy and_wanted wear
Though as_for_that the_passing there
Had worn them really about the_same
And_both_that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black
Oh I_kept the_first for_another day
Yet knowing how way_leads on to way
I_doubted if_I should ever come back
I shall be telling this_with a_sigh
Somewhere ages and_ages hence
Two_roads diverged in a_wood and_I
I_took the one_less traveled by
And that has made all the_difference
